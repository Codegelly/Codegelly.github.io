I'm finally finished with this project. It took the full two weeks to finish the project plus a day. Luckily i finished before the two week grace period. 
In my project I went through a lot of what I learned throughout these two months. I'm honestly not even sure what to say. I started out strong and then in the middle I faltered due to a technical issue with learn. I had done the beginning to the middle part of tic tac toe and all my work was deleted and then even with the help of ask a question it didnt work for about 3-4 days. I got discouraged, I forgot things and I ended up failling waaaay behind. The thing that helped me the most was pair programming. I got with a group of students who were also trying to work through their own issues be it with the in browser ide or not understanding parts of the material we were covering. At the end of the day I will definetly say I would have been able to do it without them. Pair programming, outside resources such as udemy, and extra help from some coder friends of mine made me able to get this far. I finished my project and I actually understand why each code works!
